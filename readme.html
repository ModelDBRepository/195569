This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Huang S, Hong S, De Schutter E (2015) Non-linear leak currents affect
mammalian neuron physiology. Front Cell Neurosci 9:432

This model was contributed by Dr. S. Hong.

To run check that a recent version of NEURON (available at
<a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">www.neuron.yale.edu</a>) with python and mpi is installed.  Then compile
the mod files with nrnivmodl, (or mknrndll on mac or pc).  Finally
run the simulation with a command like

python fig1_run.py

Then display the results which are similar to Fig 2A in the paper with a command like:

python fig1_show.py

which should generate a figure like:
